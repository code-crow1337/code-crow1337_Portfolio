## Needs to be fixed
1. Re-render the navbar to show where the user at. Right now the class doesn't get applied cause it doesn't get re-rendered. 
2. Fix so the user can click on the mail icon and get it copied to clipboard. Or open in their own email. 


### Nice to have
1. Progress bar at the top where the user is on the page. So full is at the bottom.
